Implementation of SVM classifier
The SVM (Support Vector Machine) is a supervised machine learning algorithm typically used for binary classification problems. Here we will be having two classes for cancer detection, i.e., Benign and Malignant.
Dataset: We will be using Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set for our experiments
Training will be done using Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD.
Feature Selection task is performed with Correlation & P-values threshold
By the end of training after 2048 epoch, we receive accuracy on test dataset: 0.9821280701754386
